This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

AP Process Automation

This project aims to automate the Accounts Payable (AP) process for improved efficiency, accuracy, and security. By leveraging advanced technologies such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Blockchain, this solution streamlines invoice receipt, validation, approval, and payment processing while minimizing human intervention.

Key Features

End-to-End Automation

Fully automated workflow from invoice receipt to payment processing with minimal human intervention.
RPA-driven email extraction ensures no invoice is missed.
Intelligent Data Extraction

AI-powered OCR tools like LayoutLMv3, Tesseract, and Google Vision handle diverse invoice formats, including multilingual ones, and extract key details with high accuracy.
Rapid Invoice Processing

RPA bots continuously monitor inboxes, processing invoices immediately upon arrival with real-time data extraction and validation.
Advanced Data Validation

ML models standardize, clean, and validate data against Purchase Orders (POs) and Goods Receipt Notes (GRNs).
Automated error detection fixes common OCR misinterpretations.
Enhanced Security with Blockchain

Blockchain ensures tamper-proof, transparent records for invoice approvals, offering an auditable trail for compliance and security.
Global Payment Efficiency

Real-time currency conversion and automated payment processing optimize international transactions.
Real-Time Dashboards & Insights

Centralized dashboards for procurement, management, receiving, and AP teams, offering insights into cash flow management, DPO tracking, and fraud detection.
Smart Approval Workflows

Hierarchical, multi-level approval workflows based on invoice value, with automated email notifications to ensure timely approvals.
Fraud Prevention & Compliance

AI-driven anomaly detection flags suspicious invoices, and automated compliance checks ensure adherence to tax regulations and company policies.
Scalable & Adaptable

Easily integrates with ERP systems like SAP, Oracle, QuickBooks, and Xero, adapting to changing business needs and regulatory requirements.
Technologies Used

RPA (Robotic Process Automation)
AI & OCR (LayoutLMv3, Tesseract, Google Vision)
Machine Learning (ML Models)
Blockchain (for secure and transparent record-keeping)
AvaTax API (for real-time tax calculations)
SAP HANA (for invoice storage and synchronization)
ERP Integration (SAP, Oracle, QuickBooks, Xero)
Setup & Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.x
Node.js and npm (for front-end and dashboard development)
SAP HANA, Oracle, or Xero (for ERP integration)
Avalara API key (for tax calculations)
Usage

Invoice Processing: Invoices are automatically extracted, validated, and processed upon receipt via RPA bots.
Approval Workflows: Invoices that meet certain criteria are routed through hierarchical approval workflows, ensuring timely payments.
Dashboards & Insights: Access real-time data and actionable insights through centralized dashboards.
Assumptions and Limitations

Data Accuracy: The solution assumes OCR and RPA tools will extract data with high accuracy. However, manual validation may be required for complex cases.
Vendor Formats: It assumes that vendors follow consistent invoice formats, although occasional discrepancies might require adjustments.
API and Network Stability: The solution is designed to be resilient, but API failures or network outages could temporarily disrupt processing.
